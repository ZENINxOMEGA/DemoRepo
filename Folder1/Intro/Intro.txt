I’m Aniket Sharma, a Computer Science student at GLA University, Mathura, and currently the President of the Esports Club. I’m deeply passionate about gaming, technology, and leadership. As the founder of OMEGA eSports and head of my university's esports initiatives, I’ve successfully organized major tournaments and events that blend competitive spirit with strategic planning. Alongside, I’ve completed internships in Web Development and GenAI, where I applied my skills to real-world projects. With a strong academic foundation, hands-on experience, and a continuous drive to grow, I’m working towards building a future where tech, innovation, and gaming come together meaningfully.
